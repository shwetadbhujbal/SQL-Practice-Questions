Number of Comments Per User in 30 days before 2020-02-10

Return the total number of comments received for each user in the 30 or less days before 2020-02-10. 
Don't output users who haven't received any comment in the defined time period.
user_id:int
created_at:datetime
number_of_comments:int

Hint:
Filter dataset by relative date range
It's useful to use relative date range in case you need to implement some minor changes quickly
Make sure created_at field is interpreted as date


# PostGreSQL Solution:

select user_id, sum(number_of_comments)
from fb_comments_count
where created_at between TO_DATE('2020-02-10','YYYY-MM-DD') -30 
and TO_DATE('2020-02-10','YYYY-MM-DD')
group by user_id
