Users With Two Statuses

Find users who are both a viewer and streamer.

user_id:int
session_start:datetime
session_end:datetime
session_id:int
session_type:varchar

Hint:
Filter the dataset by number of unique session types.
As filter is set on aggregated measure, you can use HAVING clause


MYSQL Solution 1:

SELECT DISTINCT(streaming.user_id) as user_id 
FROM (
    SELECT user_id
    FROM twitch_sessions
    WHERE LOWER(session_type) = 'streamer'
    ) AS streaming
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT user_id
    FROM twitch_sessions
    WHERE LOWER(session_type) = 'viewer'
    ) AS viewing
ON viewing.user_id = streaming.user_id


MYSQL Solution 2:

SELECT distinct(t1.user_id )
FROM twitch_sessions t1 inner join twitch_sessions t2 
on t1.user_id = t2.user_id 
and t1.session_type = 'streamer' and t2.session_type = 'viewer'
order by t1.user_id
