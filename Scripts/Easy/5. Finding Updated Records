5. Finding Updated Records
We have a table with employees and their salaries, however, some of the records are old and contain outdated salary information. 
Find the current salary of each employee assuming that salaries increase each year. 
Output their id, first name, last name, department ID, and current salary. Order your list by employee ID in ascending order.


#postgresql Solution


SELECT id,
       first_name,
       last_name,
       department_id,
       max(salary)
FROM ms_employee_salary
GROUP BY id,
         first_name,
         last_name,
         department_id
ORDER BY id ASC

Solution 2 Using CTE


with cte as(select id,
           first_name,
        last_name,
        department_id,
        salary,
        row_number() over(partition by id order by salary desc) as rw_
from ms_employee_salary
)
select id,
         first_name,
        last_name,
        department_id,
        salary
from cte 
where rw_ =1
order by id
