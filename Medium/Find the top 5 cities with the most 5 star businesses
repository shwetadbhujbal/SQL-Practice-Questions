Find the top 5 cities with the most 5 star businesses

Find the top 5 cities with the most 5-star businesses. Output the city name along with the number of 5-star businesses.
In the case of multiple cities having the same number of 5-star businesses, use the ranking function returning the lowest rank in the group and 
output cities with a rank smaller than or equal to 5.

Table: yelp_business

business_id:varchar
name:varchar
neighborhood:varchar
address:varchar
city:varchar
state:varchar
postal_code:varchar
latitude:float
longitude:float
stars:float
review_count:int
is_open:int
categories:varchar

Hint: 
Use the COUNT() function to count businesses.
Use the WHERE clause to find records with 5 stars.
Group records by the city.
Use the RANK() function to rank the cities based on the number of businesses.
Output cities with rank smaller than or equal to 5.

MySql solution:

select city, 
count_of_5_stars
from (select city, 
count(distinct(business_id)) as count_of_5_stars,
rank() over(order by count(distinct(business_id)) desc) as rnk 
from yelp_business
WHERE stars = 5
GROUP BY city) a
where rnk <= 5
