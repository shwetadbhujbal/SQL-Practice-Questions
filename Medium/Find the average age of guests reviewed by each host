Find records with the value of 'host' for the from_type column in the airbnb_reviews dataset.
Use the WHERE clause to apply conditions.
Group records by the from_user.


select from_user, avg(age) from airbnb_reviews
inner join airbnb_guests on airbnb_reviews.to_user = airbnb_guests.guest_id
where from_type = "host"
and to_type = "guest"
group by from_user
